	With so much bad news in the world today, from global disasters to national budget cuts, sometimes it’s good to be reminded that not everything out there is terrible. In fact, there’s a lot going on across the globe and country which is truly great – but receives little attention.

To help you look on the brighter side, and to inspire you to “be the change you want to see”, we’ve collected five of our very favourite charity blogs.

From national charities with very specific causes, to larger initiatives with broader intentions, the key similarities between these charities is that they all do a great job of running passionate, informative and inspiring blogs that will make you want to get out there and do something awesome…<br>

<span>Random Acts of Kindness</span><br>
Are you a RAKtivist already? Perhaps you are but don’t yet know that there’s an initiative created just for people like you, who love to give back in sometimes small but always positive ways. Coming off the back of the dangerous and controversial “NEKnominate” trend, RAKnominate fast became a popular and positive alternative, spawning a whole new movement dedicated to Random Act of Kindness. The website’s blog is packed with great resources, awesome stories, initiatives you can get involved in and inspiring acts which will make you want to put a smile on some deserving faces.<br>

<span>GiveDirectly</span><br>

One of charity appraisal group, GiveWell‘s, top charities to donate to in 2016, GiveDirectly is a charity which aims to bridge that gap between the money you donate and the impact it has for the extreme poor, making your donation more personal and immediate by helping you to give as directly to a specific recipient as possible.  The GiveDirectly blog is full of touching personal stories, fascinating insights into the process and interesting examinations of how we “do” charity today – plus how this can be better.<br>

<span>Just Giving</span><br>

It may be a platform for fundraising rather than a charity in its own right, but dealing with thousands of causes daily, Just Giving’s blog is a wealth of information and inspiration. For anyone considering launching a fundraising campaign, Just Giving‘s posts are full of ideas and tip to help you maximise the amount you raise. For everyone else, the blog is full of great stories and initiatives worth knowing about.<br><br>
